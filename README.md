# Credit Card approval
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting credit card approval decisions. The project encompasses several key phases, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model fine-tuning.

### Features
- Data Cleaning: Comprehensive preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that inform model development.
- Model Fine-Tuning: Optimization of model parameters to enhance performance and accuracy in predicting credit card approvals.

In both the files there is the code as well as the analysis.
